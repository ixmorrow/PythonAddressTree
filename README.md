# PythonAddressTree
This is my first attempt at a project in the Web3 space! The idea behind it was to create an address tree explorer on the Ethereum network that, given an address, would
display all of the addresses it has had a transaction with, the amount in Wei of that transaction, and recursively do the same for all of those addresses and so on and so fort.
Right now, I've got the bare bones of it down but it's definitely not a finished product, as it does not do anything recursively and only displays the addresses associated with the
given address. This was just a project I made for fun, as well as practice - so the goal wasn't production level quality.
